# What Not To Wear: An Edge Browser Extension

## Introduction 

In today's day and age, there is increased desire to buy clothes from sustainable brands. A clothes brand is often described as sustainable if the company makes efforts to lessen its environmental impact, refrains from using animal products, and treats their workers with respect, often through humane working conditions and fair pay. People would like to shop sustainably, but it's often difficult to know which brands are sustainable and which are't since much of the raw data are behind paywalls. So, consumers must often navigate to websites, many of which are not commonly known, to understand how sustainable their favorite brands are. It would be useful to have a browser extension that informs consumers on how sustainable brands are since the extension is always within an online shopper's field of view.

What Not to Wear provides a Sustainability Score (a percentage out of 100%, 100% being the most sustainable) and a break-down of that score according to three metrics: People, Planet, and Animals. Currently, due to data paywalls and lack of time, the current iteration of this project contains a static page for H&M's Sustainability Score. So the extension currently serves demo-ing purposes. If you'd like to contribute please let us know!
